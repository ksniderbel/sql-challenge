WeatherPy - Analyzing Global Weather Trends
For this project, we will analyze employee data for Pwelett Hackard from the 1980s and the 1990s.  Data files were received in the form of .csv files:  employees, titles, departments, salaries, dept_emp (employees by department) and dept_manager (managers by department).

Data was modeled based on observations of fields in each file and mapped to the appropriate data type, and the relationships between the different tables are mapped out using the ERD tool in PGAdmin as well as QuickDB.  The results are respectively provided in two files, employees_db.pgerd and employees_db.png.
